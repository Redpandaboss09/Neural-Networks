# Neural Networks
## The Purpose
I always wanted to get into ML projects yet I always questioned: how? This project is my answer. I could just have watched a tutorial and be done with it (which is a valid way to start) but that was not what I wanted to do. I decided to try and learn some of the architecture behind a Neural Network (NN) through this project.

### What I Intend
I intend to learn how I can create a NN from scratch to see how different types of functions, methods, and everything else can work together to train and test on a dataset. I'll get to what I did in the next section which is [here](#The-Project). To help differentiate a bit this project will also compare computational speed differences between languages. NN's and any training they go through does take a while (depending on size) so I want to see: how much does language affect that speed? So that's what I'll look into!
